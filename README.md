# üîê Multi-Algorithmic Password Strength Analyzer

A robust and extensible tool to evaluate password strength using multiple attack models. This analyzer estimates how long it would take to crack a password using various real-world methods like brute-force, dictionary attacks, and rule-based pattern analysis.

## üöÄ Features

- üî¢ Entropy-based strength evaluation
- üìñ Dictionary attack simulation
- ‚öôÔ∏è Rule-based pattern matching (e.g., substitutions like `@` for `a`)
- üîê Brute-force time estimation
- üåó Dark mode enabled frontend UI
- üí° Real-time strength feedback
- üìä Summary of estimated crack times across algorithms
- üß∞ **Secret Vault with file upload & destruction mechanism**
- ‚ùå Marks as "immune" if crack time exceeds 100 years

## üîí Secret Vault Feature

This project includes a hidden **Secure Vault** feature:

- üóùÔ∏è When a **pre-defined "special password"** is entered, a hidden vault UI is revealed.
- üì§ You can **upload sensitive files** to this vault.
- üîÅ To **view or download files**, you must re-enter the exact same password.
- ‚ùå If the password is incorrect during re-entry:
  - **All files in the vault are deleted permanently** for security.

> This ensures an extra layer of confidentiality and adds a destruct-on-wrong-password security mechanism.
