# 🔐 Multi-Algorithmic Password Strength Analyzer

This project provides a basic implementation of a password strength analyzer using multiple algorithms. It evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria to determine its robustness.

> ⚙️ **Project Status**: _Actively under development_

## 🎯 Project Goal

The aim of this project is to develop a robust password strength analyzer that evaluates passwords against various types of attacks, such as:

- Brute-force attacks  
- Dictionary attacks  
- Common password attacks  
- Pattern-based attacks  
- Entropy-based analysis  

The goal is to build a multi-layered evaluation system that reflects real-world password security scenarios and can be used to recommend safer passwords.

## 🧠 Features

- **Multiple Evaluation Criteria**: Assesses password strength using various algorithms and checks.
- **Simple Implementation**: Easy-to-understand code suitable for beginners.
- **Extensible Design**: Can be expanded to include more sophisticated checks and algorithms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/annant-parashar/Multi-Algorithmic-Password-Strength-Analyzer.git
   cd Multi-Algorithmic-Password-Strength-Analyzer
   ```

2. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python pass.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

Upon running the script, you will be prompted to enter a password. The program will then evaluate the strength of the entered password based on predefined criteria and display the result.

## 📌 How It Works

While the current implementation is straightforward, it can be enhanced by incorporating the following checks:

- **Length Check**: Ensures the password meets a minimum length requirement.
- **Character Variety**: Checks for the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Common Passwords**: Compares against a list of commonly used passwords to prevent weak choices.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Estimates the randomness of the password.
- **Dictionary Words**: Detects the presence of dictionary words which can be easily guessed.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Integration with advanced strength estimation libraries like `zxcvbn`
- GUI for better interaction
- Real-time feedback while typing
- Password strength reports
- Cloud-based API for integration with other tools
